ðŸ¤– **Webhook Setup Instructions**

**Bot Information:**
- FID: ${botFid}
- Username: @${botUsername}
- Webhook URL: http://localhost:3001 (or your public URL)

**Neynar Webhook Configuration:**
1. Go to https://neynar.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to the Webhooks tab
3. Create a new webhook with these settings:

**Event Type:** cast.created
**Target URL:** http://localhost:3001 (or your public URL)
**Filters:**
- mentioned_fids: ${botFid} (for @mentions)
- parent_author_fids: ${botFid} (for replies to your casts)

**What this enables:**
âœ… Real-time notifications when someone @mentions your bot
âœ… Real-time notifications when someone replies to your casts
âœ… Automatic AI-powered responses to comments and mentions
âœ… No more polling - instant engagement!

**Testing:**
1. Make sure the webhook server is running (port 3001)
2. Comment on one of your bot's casts
3. The bot should respond within seconds!

**Public URL Options:**
- Use ngrok: \`ngrok http 3001\`
- Use localtunnel: \`npx localtunnel --port 3001\`
- Deploy to your own domain
- Use Cloudflare tunnels

**Note:** Free services like ngrok may have delivery issues. For production, use your own domain.
